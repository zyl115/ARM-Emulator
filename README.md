# Specifications 

## Parse
---
### Parsing expressions

Working. Allows arithmetic operators '+', '-' and '*'. Allows symbol. Allows hexadecimal (0x) and binary (0b) input. Whitespace not allowed within an expression. Literals that is larger than 32 bit will overflow and result will be wrong. VisUAL throws an exception. Tested with unit tests. 

### Parsing flexible op2

Working. Allows symbol. Tested with unit tests.

### Conditions

Working. Instructions EQU, FILL, DCD, DCB, END does not allow conditions. Tested manually at frontend. 

### Parsing comments

Working. Any string after the character ';' will be treated as comment for each line. Will not be read as part of the assembly code. Tested manually at frontend. 

### Symbol Table
Working. Labels will be stored in symbol table, maps to the instruction address. Exceptions: EQU, DCD, DCB, FILL. Forward references allowed (up to 10 'layers'). Tested manually at frontend. 

### Case sensitivity
Case insensitive. All characters converted to uppercase before parse. There is no difference between a symbol 'apple' and 'APPLE'. Tested with unit tests.

5. ADDS, R0, R1, R2, LSL, #5+5+symbol

Comments: Accept expression and literal for Operand 2. 

Issue: Able to set Rd as R13, R14 and R15 unconditionally. 

Test Status: Tested manually at top level.

Comments: Accept any values. Expression and literal treated equally. 

Test Status: Tested manually at top level.

### LDR
Summary: Load Register 

Syntax:

3. LDR{B}{cond} dest, [source], OFFSET Post-indexed addressing 

Comments: Working. All three indexing mode supported. 
- Offset must be within the range of -4095 to 4095. 
- Source must be within data memory. Returns Error when instruction memory is read. defined to be 0x100 by default. 
- Word mode: address must be word aligned
- Byte mode: stores the smallest 8 bit if number greater than 8 bit is used
- Returns 0 for uninitialised memory
- R15 as source allowed for word mode, deprecated for byte mode.
- Destination must be different from source register when pre or post index addressing used. 

Test Status: Tested with property test during individual stage. Working. 

### STR
Summary: Store Register 

Syntax: 
1. STR{B}{cond} dest, [source {, OFFSET}] Offset addressing
2. STR{B}{cond} dest, [source, OFFSET]! Pre-indexed addressing
3. STR{B}{cond} dest, [source], OFFSET Post-indexed addressing 

Comments: Working. All three indexing mode supported. 
- Offset must be within the range of -4095 to 4095. 
- Source must be within data memory. Returns Error when instruction memory is read. defined to be 0x100 by default. 
- Word mode: address must be word aligned
- Byte mode: stores the smallest 8 bit if number greater than 8 bit is used
- Returns 0 for uninitialised memory
- R15 not allowed as destination
